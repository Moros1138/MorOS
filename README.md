Moros1138's Useless Kernel

## Why?

Why not?  I've played around with a few bootsector programs in the past, but never anything that involved going into 32-bit protected mode. The exercise is to see if I can learn what I need to know to make a port of my GetHome game, but as a kernel. Not for any practical reason other than fun and education.

Intially, the code and methodoloy will be heavily borrowed from/influenced by the guides and resources available for all of the internet at [The OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones)
